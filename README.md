You are given an array A consisting of N integers. The number of integers N is even. You can perform the following 2 operations:

1. Increase the value of some element Ai by 1.

2. Delete some adjacent elements A, and A₁+1 such that they are consecutive prime numbers. (A, is a prime number and A₁+1 is the next prime number).

You want to delete all the elements of A. What is the minimum number of operations that must be performed?

Example
Input: A =

N = 4

Output: 5

Explanation:

We increase A2 and A3 by 1. [2

operations]

Remove A₂ and A3 as they are consecutive primes [1 operation]

A = [1, 3]

A = [1, 3, 5, 3] Increase A₁ by 1 [1 operation] consecutive primes. [1 operation]

A = [2, 3]

Remove A₁ and A2 as they are

Total operations = 5
